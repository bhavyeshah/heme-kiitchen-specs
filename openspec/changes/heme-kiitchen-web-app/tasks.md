## 1. Project Setup

- [ ] 1.1 Initialise Next.js (App Router) project with TypeScript
- [ ] 1.2 Initialise Express API project with TypeScript
- [ ] 1.3 Set up monorepo structure (apps/web, apps/api, shared types package)
- [ ] 1.4 Configure environment variables (.env.example) for: ADMIN_SECRET, API_BASE_URL, UPI ID, business WhatsApp number, CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME, CLOUDINARY_API_KEY, CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET, WHATSAPP_PHONE_NUMBER_ID, WHATSAPP_ACCESS_TOKEN
- [ ] 1.5 Add `/public/images/logo.*` placeholder structure (product images are stored on Cloudinary, not locally)
- [ ] 1.6 Create `data/` directory with empty seed files: `products.json`, `orders.json`

## 2. Site Content — Data Layer

- [ ] 2a.1 Define `SiteContent` TypeScript type — fields: tagline (string, max 150), description (string, max 500), highlights (string[], each max 80 chars), instagram_handle (string | null)
- [ ] 2a.2 Implement `SiteContentRepository` with JSON file read/write (reads/writes `data/site-content.json`)
- [ ] 2a.3 Add GET /api/site-content endpoint (public, returns current site content)
- [ ] 2a.4 Add PATCH /api/site-content endpoint (admin-only; validates tagline non-empty and within 150 chars, description within 500 chars, each highlight within 80 chars; instagram_handle is optional, no validation required beyond string type)
- [ ] 2a.5 Seed `data/site-content.json` with initial tagline, brand description, highlights, and instagram_handle set to null

## 3. Product Catalog — Data Layer

- [ ] 2.1 Define `Product` TypeScript type (id, name, description, price, image_path, status) — no category or is_addon fields; flat catalogue
- [ ] 2.2 Implement `ProductRepository` with JSON file read/write and atomic save
- [ ] 2.3 Add GET /api/products endpoint (returns active products; supports include_inactive for admin)
- [ ] 2.4 Add POST /api/products endpoint (admin-only, multipart/form-data; requires name, description, price, and image file; validate all fields present and image is a valid image type; upload image to Cloudinary, store returned CDN URL as image_path in product record)
- [ ] 2.5 Add PATCH /api/products/:id endpoint (admin-only, multipart/form-data; supports updating name, description, price, status, and optionally image; validate name non-empty and price positive numeric; status accepts "active"/"inactive" only; if new image provided: upload to Cloudinary, delete old Cloudinary asset by stored public_id, update image_path to new CDN URL)
- [ ] 2.6 Seed `products.json` with initial product catalogue — dips, falafel, lavash all as flat equal entries; no category or add-on classification

<!-- Section 3 (Inventory Data Layer) removed — inventory is deferred, managed manually for now -->

## 4. Order Management — Data Layer

- [ ] 4.1 Define `Order` TypeScript type — fields: id, source, status, items, total_price, customer_name, phone, delivery_type, delivery_address (nullable), delivery_charges_applicable, payment_method, payment_status, special_instructions (nullable, max 500 chars), deleted, deleted_at (nullable), created_at, updated_at. No upi_reference field — payment handled offline via WhatsApp. Each item in `items` SHALL be `{ product_id, name, unit_price, quantity }` — name and unit_price are snapshots from the catalog at order creation time
- [ ] 4.2 Implement `OrderRepository` with JSON file read/write, atomic append, and write lock
- [ ] 4.3 Add POST /api/orders endpoint (creates order, validates items exist and are active, enforces payment method per delivery type — COD only for pickup, UPI only for home delivery, validates phone is a 10-digit Indian mobile number and stores as +91XXXXXXXXXX, snapshots name and unit_price from catalog into each order item at creation time, calculates total_price from snapshotted unit prices, no upi_reference field accepted, triggers order_placed WhatsApp notification after successful save)
- [ ] 4.4 Add GET /api/orders endpoint with filters: source, status, payment_status, delivery_type, deleted
- [ ] 4.5 Add GET /api/orders/:id endpoint
- [ ] 4.6 Add PATCH /api/orders/:id endpoint — handles: accept (pending → confirmed), decline (pending → declined), status update, payment_status update, full field edit; enforce terminal state rules; after successful status update to confirmed/dispatched/completed/declined/cancelled, send WhatsApp notification to customer phone via WhatsApp Cloud API (failure logged, does not roll back status update)
- [ ] 4.7 Add DELETE /api/orders/:id endpoint (soft delete — sets deleted=true, deleted_at=now)

## 4b. WhatsApp Notification Service
<!-- POST-DEMO: These tasks are not required for the demo. Complete after demo sign-off and once Meta business verification + template approval are in place. -->

- [ ] 4b.1 Implement `WhatsAppService` — wraps WhatsApp Cloud API; accepts phone number, template name, and template variables; sends message; logs success/failure. **If `WHATSAPP_ACCESS_TOKEN` env var is not set, skip silently and log a warning — this allows the app to run without WhatsApp configured (e.g. during demo)**
- [ ] 4b.2 Define and submit Meta message templates for approval (4 templates):
  - **order_placed**: "Dear {{1}}, your order is placed."
  - **order_status_update**: "Dear {{1}}, your order status was {{2}}, and new status is {{3}}."
  - **order_completed**: "Dear {{1}}, your order status was {{2}}, and new status is {{3}}. Enjoy the indulgence."
  - **order_cancelled**: "Dear {{1}}, we regret to inform that your order is cancelled. We would love to have you back."
- [ ] 4b.3 Integrate `WhatsAppService` into POST /api/orders — send order_placed template after order creation; catch and log errors without re-throwing
- [ ] 4b.4 Integrate `WhatsAppService` into PATCH /api/orders/:id — send appropriate template after successful status update: order_status_update for confirmed/dispatched/declined, order_completed for completed, order_cancelled for cancelled; catch and log errors without re-throwing

## 5. Admin Authentication — API & Middleware

- [ ] 5.1 Implement session-based auth middleware in Express (reads ADMIN_SECRET from env)
- [ ] 5.2 Add POST /api/auth/login endpoint
- [ ] 5.3 Add POST /api/auth/logout endpoint
- [ ] 5.4 Protect all admin-only API routes with auth middleware

## 6. Customer Storefront — UI

- [ ] 6.1 Build shared storefront layout — header with logo (links to homepage, appears on every page), nav links, cart icon; footer with FSSAI licence number and conditional Instagram link (renders @handle linking to instagram.com/[handle] only when instagram_handle is non-null in site-content)
- [ ] 6.2 Build Homepage: fetch content from GET /api/site-content; render hero section with tagline, brand description, and highlights list dynamically; single "Order Now" CTA button linking to /products
- [ ] 6.3 Build Products page: grid of product cards (image, name, description, price, "Add to Cart" button); cart icon in header showing item count
- [ ] 6.4 Build About/Info page: brand story, FSSAI licence number, FSSAI certificate rendered inline via PDF.js (pdfjs-dist, self-hosted); no download button or link to raw PDF

- [ ] 8.3 Build payment method selector — COD + UPI shown for pickup; UPI only for home delivery; switching delivery type to home delivery auto-selects UPI and hides COD; UPI selection shows a note: "After placing your order, contact us on WhatsApp with your Order ID to receive payment details." No transaction reference field.
- [ ] 8.4 Build customer details form (name + phone always required; phone field labelled "Enter your WhatsApp number — order updates will be sent here", validated as 10-digit Indian mobile number, stored as +91XXXXXXXXXX; address required for home delivery only; optional special instructions textarea with live character counter, max 500 chars)
- [ ] 8.5 Implement form validation with inline error messages
- [ ] 8.6 Wire form submission to POST /api/orders; disable submit button during request
- [ ] 8.7 Build order confirmation page — order ID displayed prominently; pickup: order ref + summary + "We will confirm your order via WhatsApp" + "To make any changes, contact us on WhatsApp with your Order ID"; home delivery: order ref + summary + delivery charge notice + "To complete your payment and confirm your order, contact us on WhatsApp at [business number] with your Order ID.

- [ ] 9.5 Build create-offline-order form (customer details with phone labelled "Customer WhatsApp Number" validated as 10-digit Indian mobile number, delivery type selector, item picker from product catalog, payment method conditional on delivery type, optional special instructions textarea with live character counter, max 500 chars)
- [ ] 9.6 Verify all admin pages pass mobile layout check (375px viewport, 44px tap targets)

## 10. Admin Panel — Branding

- [ ] 10a.1 Build admin branding page (/admin/branding) — form with tagline field (150 char limit + counter), brand description textarea (500 char limit + counter), highlights list (add / edit / remove individual items, each 80 char max), Instagram handle field (optional, plain text, no counter needed); save wires to PATCH /api/site-content; inline validation errors
